    "        - Executors support heterogenous computation contexts, including GPGPU, and grid computing\n",
    "    - [Coroutine TS](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/n4736.pdf) support which is planned to be included in C++20\n",
    "    - The current futures defined in the [_Concurrency TS_](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0159r0.html) are not sufficient\n",
    "    - Plan is for a  _Concurrency TS part 2_ which can be incorporated into C++20"
